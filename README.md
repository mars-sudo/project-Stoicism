# project-Stoicism
Personal project to build a web app that allows users to log their virtues and vices and make journal entries on their growth.

We'll write a web app called Project Stoicisim that allows users to log their virtues/vices and make journal entries on how they balance both for their personal growth. 
The Project Stoicisim home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. 
Once logged in, a user can search through a list of descriptive adjectives, create a new topic, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.  

Three core relationships
1. Contemplating virtue in yourself
2. Contepmlating virtue in others
3. Welcoming your fate
